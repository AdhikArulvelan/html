  <h2><B>Snow Man</B></h2>
<P>
  Get 5 rocks and keep them for later, along with 2 sticks. Get one big, one medium, and one small snow ball.
stack the snowballs from biggest to smallest, finally add 2 rocks for eyes on the smallest snowball, and 3 rocks for buttons on the medium snowball. Add the sticks as arms. For video instruction, click the link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=206yVUMtQBs">Video Demo</a>

  <h2><B>Giant Snowball</B></h2>
  <P>
    Get a small snowball, about the size of a small snowball used to build the snow man, and roll it around for about 15 to 20 minutes, in the snow. And there is your giant snowball!

    <h2>Snow Sculpture</h2>
  <p>
    Get tons, and I mean a lot of snow, form it into an about 4 feet renctangle, top to bottom. Then sculpt it using a scalple or trowel. Make it into whatever you want. Here is a video of some people building some snow sculptures <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y84-ZA9YBo>Link</a>
